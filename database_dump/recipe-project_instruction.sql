Add the chopped white and pale green scallions; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and translucent, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup reserved marinade to the Dutch oven.

At this point, you can put the marinated beef in a zip top bag and freeze it for later.',127),(137,'Cook the bulgogi: \r\nHeat the canola oil in a large cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Make sure the pan is hot before you add the bulgogi. Add the bulgogi in a single layer. You may need to cook it in batches. The meat should not overlap so that it chars nicely without steaming and releasing liquid. Cook until lightly charred and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.',127),(138,'Serve:\r\nTransfer the bulgogi onto a serving platter or serve it straight from the pan.

Mix well with a fork or a spoon.\r\n\r\nLay a chicken cutlet on top of the flour. Sprinkle some of the flour mixture on top and press with your hands to coat.

Discard any leftover flour.',143),(152,'Cook the chicken:\r\nPlace a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Tilt the skillet to evenly coat it with oil. The oil should shimmer, but not smoke. Add the dredged chicken cutlets in a single layer. Let them cook, without moving, until the bottoms are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nUse tongs to flip the cutlets and cook the other side is lightly browned and the chicken is cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. If your skillet isn’t big enough, you can cook the chicken in 2 batches.\r\n\r\nTransfer the chicken onto a clean plate and tent it with foil. Set it aside while you make the sauce, which will be made in the same skillet.',143),(153,'Cook the vegetables:\r\nTurn the heat down to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.

Sauté until tender, 2 to 3 minutes.',143),(154,'Make the sauce:\r\nAdd the white wine and scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon, loosening any browned bits. Bring the wine to a simmer and cook until the alcohol smell dissipates, about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nStir in the heavy cream. Bring it to a gentle simmer.

Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with more salt and black pepper, if needed. Serve!\r\n\r\nLeftovers keeps well since it has a moist sauce. Refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days and reheat it on the stovetop or in the microwave. Add a splash of heavy cream if it feels dry. \r\n\r\nI don’t recommend freezing this dish since the texture of the sauce gets wonky.

Return to oven and roast for another 7 minutes. It’s okay if some of the asparagus overlap.\r\n\r\nThe sheet pan is done when the shrimp have turned a light pink color and are firm in texture. The asparagus should be browned on the edges and fork tender.',160),(173,'Cut asparagus and drizzle with garlic butter:\r\nCarefully remove the asparagus from the sheet pan and chop into 3-4 pieces. Place back onto the sheet pan with the shrimp and coat everything lightly with half the garlic butter sauce.',160),(174,'Serve:\r\nServe asparagus and shrimp over thin spaghetti with the remaining garlic butter sauce and fresh parsley.',160);
